Reset Styles (lines 1-44):

These styles set default values for various HTML elements to create a consistent baseline across different browsers.
Margin, padding, border, font size, and inheritance are set to 0 or inherit for most elements.
Display properties are set for HTML5 elements to ensure correct rendering in older browsers.
Body line height is set to 1.
Unordered and ordered lists have styling removed.
Blockquotes and quotes do not display quotation marks.
Tables use border-collapse and border-spacing for consistent layout.
Media Queries (lines 45-95):

These media queries are based on Bootstrap 4 breakpoints, but currently only include placeholder comments.
You can customize these queries to adjust styles based on different screen sizes.
Currently, comments exist for:
Extra small devices (portrait phones) - not included as default in Bootstrap
Small devices (landscape phones)
Medium devices (tablets)
Large devices (desktops)
Extra large devices (large desktops)
An additional custom query exists to set card deck card width to 100% on screens under 950px.
Notes:

This code does not include any specific styling beyond the reset and media query structure.
You will need to add your own styles within the media queries to achieve the desired look and feel for different screen sizes.
Consider reviewing additional resources on CSS resets and media queries for further customization and best practices.
